A simple yet powerful library management system built with Flask, MySQL, and a straightforward HTML/CSS/JavaScript front end. This project demonstrates a full-stack application that allows users to manage books and user records efficiently.

## Team Members

This project is the result of the collaborative efforts of the following individuals:

- **[Marc Denisse Avila](https://github.com/nixxxxe)** 
- **[Hannah Restauro](https://github.com/hanako0311)**


## Features

- User management: Add, update, and delete users.
- Book management: Add, update, and delete books.
- Borrowing system: Users can borrow and return books. 
- Real-time updates: Front-end updates without page reloads.

## Current Status

As of now, the back-end functionalities, including the REST API for user and book management, are operational. The borrowing system is also implemented in the back-end. However, the front-end is still in the development phase and might contain errors or incomplete features. We are actively working on refining the front-end to provide a seamless user experience.
